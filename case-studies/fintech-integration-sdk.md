# Problem

My client is a small FinTech startup that builds financial portfolio analytics APIs and
microfrontends. Their customers are financial institutions who embed those APIs and
microfrontends into their own applications in order to offer accurate and actionable financial
advice to their end-users.

At the time, it cost my client $XX,000 in labor for an integration project with a single
financial institution. Each subsequent integration would take another $XX,000. This was a major
expense that severely limited how many financial institutions could afford their software. They
needed to find a way to make these integrations much cheaper, so that they could scale their
business.

# Solution

I built a reusable JavaScript SDK that financial institutions could use to integrate with my
client's software. This SDK was easily installable via NPM and exposed two sets of
functionality: (1) API integration, and (2) Microfrontend integration via iFrames.


# Impact

Before, it would cost my client $XX,000 for every integration. After my solution was
implemented, my client's cost to integrate was reduced to $0 (zero dollars). Financial
institutions were even able to integrate with my clients without involvement from my client's
developer team, leading to greater revenues and much greater profitability.
