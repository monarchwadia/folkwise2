You should build your community of users before you build your MVP.

Your software product is only as good as the community that uses and supports it. That's why building an online community should precede building your software product MVP or even looking for funding.

Think about it this way: your MVP is only a minimum viable product. It's not going to be perfect. And it's not going to be successful without a community of users to help you fine-tune it and make it better.

The same goes for funding. Sure, you might be able to get some initial funding to get your MVP off the ground. But if you don't have a community of users to support and promote your product, you're not going to be able to sustain that funding.

So how do you build an online community? Start by telling your story. Share your vision for your product and why you're passionate about it. Then, ask for feedback and input from your potential users. What features would they like to see? What problems are they hoping your product will solve?

Engage with your potential community members on social media, in forums, and in other online places where they congregate. And most importantly, listen to what they have to say. Take their feedback to heart and use it to make your product better.

Building an online community takes time and effort, but it's worth it. By doing so, you'll ensure that your MVP is successful and that you have the support you need to keep your product and your business thriving.
