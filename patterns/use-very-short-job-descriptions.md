title: Use very short job descriptions
category: hiring
---

Short, casual job descriptions tend to outperform long, formal ones. Candidates find them easier to read, and your team will find them easier to manage.

Here is a sample JD that will outperform most long-form job descriptions.

```
Title     : Senior Full Stack React Developer
Employer  : CompanyName
Location  : Remote, Anywhere
Salary    : $ 100,000 - 150,000

CompanyName is a SaaS platform that helps junior developers
in remote areas of the country get hired faster through the
power of hackathons.

This role will help build Version 2 of our platform. We're
looking for people who can make the right technical choices
in collaboration with our existing team. This is a parallel
build project, which means you'll be building towards
feature parity with our existing V1. Speed and clean code
are both of the essence, but not at the cost of good coding
practices.

Here's what we're looking for:
1. 5+ years of experience in software engineering
2. 1+ years of experience leading teams
3. React, Typescript and Node experience is a plus
4. Experience in parallel build projects is a plus
5. Experience mentoring junior developers is a huge plus
