title: Use very short job descriptions
category: hiring

Shorter JDs which are 2 or 3 paragraphs long, with no more than 8 bullet points, lead to healthier hiring pipelines. They're great for candidate experience because they're short and sweet. The intentional lack of details also prevents qualified candidates from self-selecting out due to a misunderstanding. They're also really easy for teams to generate and iterate on.

Here are a few sample JDs that you could use to get started.

```
Senior Software Engineer, React/TypeScript
$100,000 - $150,000
Remote, Anywhere

CompanyName is a SaaS platform that helps junior developers
in remote areas of the country get hired faster through the
power of hackathons. We're enriching the lives of 
individuals, families, and communities across North America
by providing career switchers and bootcamp grads with
access to top-tier remote software engineering jobs,
regardless of where the candidate lives.

This role will help build Version 2 of our platform. We're
looking for people who can make the right technical choices
in collaboration with our existing team. This is a parallel
build project, which means you'll be building towards
feature parity with our existing V1. Speed and clean code
are both of the essence, but not at the cost of good coding
practices.

Here's what we're looking for:
1. 5+ years of experience in software engineering
2. 1+ years of experience leading teams
3. React, Typescript and Node experience is a plus
4. Experience in parallel build projects is a plus
5. Experience mentoring junior developers is a huge plus
