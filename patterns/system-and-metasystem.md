* Focusing on 



Adam and Betty were two engineers who worked on different parts of a space station. Adam normally worked on the station's power generation systems, while Betty usually worked on the life support systems, but they were both responsible for general maintenance and repairs on the power station.

One day, the space station was hit by a meteor, and the station's habitation ring suffered major structural damage. Thankfully, there were no immediate casualties, but the structural damage was slowly spreading and threatened to cause a cascading failure, destroying the entire station. The situation was dire, and time was of the essence.

Adam rushed to fix the structural damage, but he couldn't do it alone. He needed help from Betty. Betty, who had never even spoken to Adam, came to his aid, and together they fixed the habitation ring.
