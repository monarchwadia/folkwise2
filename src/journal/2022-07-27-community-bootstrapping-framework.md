This is a very basic community bootstrapping framework, but it should help you get started with your own community.

#### 1. Identify where you'll find your customers. Are there intermediaries or influential actors involved?

You'll need to identify where your potential customers are congregating, whether that's online or offline. Are there any intermediaries or influential actors involved? If so, you'll need to make sure that you have a good relationship with them.

#### 2. What value will you give your customers to interest them in your community?

You'll need to offer potential customers something of value to get them interested in your community. This could be a discount on your product, exclusive content, or early access to new features.

#### 3. Once they've joined your community, how will you engage them, to keep them active?

You'll need to keep your community members engaged by providing them with interesting content, organizing events, and responding to their questions and concerns.

#### 4. Once you've started the relationship with them, how will you capture value i.e. what will you sell them?

Once you've built up a relationship with your community members, you can start to capture value by selling them products and services.
