There was once a wise farmer. One day, her prize horse ran away.

"That's terrible," the neighours said. "We'll see," the farmer said.

The next day, her prize horse returned with a mate.

"That's amazing," the neighours said. "We'll see," the farmer said.

The next day, the new horse kicked the farmer's husband and broke his leg.

"That's terrible," the neighours said. "We'll see," the farmer said.

The next day, the army announced a draft. The farmer's husband, being injured, was spared.

"You're so lucky!" said the neighbours. "How can anyone be so lucky?"

"We'll see," replied the farmer, and continued tending her crops.
