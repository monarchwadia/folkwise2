React developers pay lots of money for good chairs. A badly designed chair will tire your back. And a badly designed keyboard will tire your hands.

Then why do so many React developers feel tired of coding?

Consider that maybe, just maybe, it's the framework that they're using.

React is now older, slower, less ergonomic than most people think. Especially when compared to other frameworks. It was built in an age when jQuery was the most popular tool of the day, and we all desperately needed to move away from it at all costs.

More recent technology is certainly more fun to use than React. 10 years of progress have borne fruit.

We are spoiled for choice these days, and so I choose frameworks and libraries that FEEL good to use

Here's the frontend stack I prefer these days:
- Svelte
- SvelteKit
- Typescript
- DaisyUI on Tailwind
- Vercel
- Yarn
- Jest
- Parcel bundler for simple projects
- SCSS occasionally. Old often means obsolete, but not always.

I'm still exploring innovations in the backend, but worthy mentions I've worked with are AdonisJS, Prisma, Koa.

Older tools with older developer experience have served their purpose. I've moved on, and I encourage others to do the same.
