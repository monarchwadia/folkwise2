We often forget how incredibly _new_ software engineering is, and that we would benefit greatly from learning from other fields.

I recently met an aspiring junior dev who had been in the US Army for 10 years. You better believe they'll be bringing **_very smart, transferable ideas_** to our industry. We're lucky they're interested in software engineering.

This is one of the reasons why I'm excited about coding bootcamps and career-switching junior devs.

Lawyers have more than 2,000 years on us. Soldiers, architects, doctors, accountants and teachers even more so. It would be wise to consider that we barely know what we're doing. Maybe we should take a page out of other professionals' books.

Can we learn from other professions how to:

- explain what we do better?
- protect our interests?
- train our students?
- express our value?
- self-regulate?
