	<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">About me.</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Monarch Wadia. I live in Toronto with my wife and my laptop. I'm a full-stack
		developer with 10+ years of experience. 5 of those years were spent building my own software
		agencies and bootstrapped startups. My interests include playing the guitar, keyboard, and
		woodwind flute (all of them very badly).
	</p>

	<p>
		I've worked on a wide range of projects, from small websites to large enterprise applications. I
		really shine when I'm working at the intersection of software development and core business
		needs. I'm able to take many variables and factors into account that my peers are not familiar
		with, including sales funnels; conversion rates; user journeys; regulations and compliance;
		talent sourcing strategy; internal business needs; and marketing.
	</p>

	<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Some fun projects that I've worked on.</h1>
	<ul class="list-disc pl-4">
		<li>
			Countless full-stack web apps, mobile apps, CLI tools, CI/CD pipelines, gigabyte-scale ETL and
			reporting, serverless lambdas, and other cool tech.
		</li>
		<li>A hackathon SaaS platform that eventually had 10,000+ software developers as users.</li>
		<li>
			Apprenticeship programs that let my team sidestep the tech talent crunch (reliably) with a
			combination of vetting, hiring, and training.
		</li>
		<li>
			Early-stage hiring processes for a freelancer talent marketplace that wanted to hire React and
			Node developers at scale.
		</li>
	</ul>
