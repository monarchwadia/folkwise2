	<H1>Coding Gym</H1>
	<p>
		Coding bootcamp is really hard. But sustaining a regular practice of daily programming is even
		harder.
	</p>
	<p>
		On an experimental basis, I'm starting to offer an affordable way for coding bootcamp grads to
		stay motivated after bootcamp is over. I will run this experiment until March 2023, and if it is
		successful, I will continue to offer this service indefinitely.
	</p>
	<p>
		Modelled after a martial arts dojo, Folkwise's coding gym offers a safe, structured, affordable
		environment for bootcamp grads to practice their programming skills on a daily basis.

		<H2>How do I benefit from this program?</H2>
		<p>Focus, attention, and grit can be obtained through structured classes.</p>
		<H2>What is the schedule like?</H2>
		<p>
			Coding Gym is structured like a martial arts gym. There are a total of 6 "in-person" classes
			per week. You can join any class per week, and you can attend as many classes as you want.
		</p>
		<H2>What is the curriculum?</H2>
		<p>Every class is</p>
		<H2>Is it fast-paced?</H2>
		<p>
			Every aspect of our program is designed for students to learn and improve at their own pace.
			That way, they develop the confidence to try, fail, and learn.
		</p>
		<H2>Eligibility criteria</H2>
		<p>Anyone can join. I would recommend that you at least 10 weeks of full-time experience</p>
