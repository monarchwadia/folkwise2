		Good software engineering practices <i>must</i> take the talent shortage into account.
	</h1>
	<p>
		Modern best practices don't take the talent shortage into account at all. They assume that there
		is an infinite supply of top-tier talent that's university-trained and instantly available for
		hire.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yet for my clients, the talent shortage is the single most painful resource constraint of the
		21st century. And it's only getting worse.

		Folkwise is an attempt to generate new coding best practices based on boots-on-the-ground
		experience. It contains my efforts to make sense of the tech talent shortage. Both for others
		and for myself.
