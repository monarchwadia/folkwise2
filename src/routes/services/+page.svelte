<p>Fun projects that I've created include:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-4">
	<li>
		Full-stack web apps, mobile apps, CLI tools, CI/CD pipelines, terabyte-scale social media
		integrations, serverless lambdas, and other cool stuff from scratch.
	</li>
	<li>
		Apprenticeship programs that let my team sidestep the tech talent crunch (reliably) with a
		combination of vetting, hiring, and training.
	</li>
	<li>
		A hackathon community that hosted 100+ hackathons in 2.5 years, with literally hundreds of
		online workshops and a community of thousands of software developers.
	</li>
	<li>
		Crafting the first hiring, vetting, and profile-enhancement processes for large freelancer
		talent networks.
	</li>
</ul>
